# SortingHat
So basically this is a sorting simulator, that every 3 seconds that creates a student with a random value for each traits.
The traits are created by the houses you define within the system with its primary traits.

Like I said the theme is Harry Potter because I love Harry Potter but it is changeable.

Instructions to change the theme and basic overview of how the code works:
Step 1: Add your own background image within the image folder and rename your image to environment_bg.png
Step 2: Go into the the main.js and scroll down to line 57. This is the start of the Enum for the houses. You can give your own house names or club names, then you give it a primary trait to the house and specify the houses color.
Step 3: Open index.html and see the magic happen.
